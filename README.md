# hello-world
Hello, dear colleagues!

This is my hello-world repository
I am carrying out experiments on polymer luminescence.
I use different type of luminescence sectrophotometers.
I'd like contribute some code to interpret raw data from LS-100 luminescence spectrophotometer, but not only.
Now I am coding the communication between PC under Windows and multimeter meTex M-3650D using Python.
I've started it on July, 2020.
